# ðŸ—œ Parse Server Starter

This starter is a minimal setup of [Parse Platform](https://parseplatform.org/) ([Server](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server) & [Dashboard](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard)) with a choice of three DB configs: [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) ([Postgis](https://postgis.net/)), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) or [Percona Server MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/software/mongodb/percona-server-for-mongodb). All services are run within [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/) is chosen as a reverse proxy server for its simplicity and great perfomance.

## Deployment
#### Local
1. `> mv example.env .env`
2. `> git clone https://github.com/kanzitelli/parse-server-starter.git`
3. `> cd parse-server-starter`
4. `> sh build-up.sh`
5. Open `http://localhost:6969/dashboard` and enter credentials from `.env` (default: `admin` for username and `12345` for password).

#### Production
`Coming soon...`

## Read it before use it
#### Cloud functions
[Parse Platform](https://parseplatform.org/) gives us an ability to write and host [Cloud Functions](https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/) on the same server with api and dashboard. You can define new functions in `server/cloud/main.js`. More information can be found [here](https://docs.parseplatform.org/cloudcode/guide/).

In order to have up-to-date running Cloud Functions (when you add a new one and don't want to rebuild whole Docker image), you just need to restart `parse-server` container. You can do it by running `> sh restart.sh`. Or just using Docker extension in VSCode or Docker Desktop app.
